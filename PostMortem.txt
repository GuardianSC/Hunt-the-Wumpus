Getting the basics of the game set up went well and somewhat working (setting up rooms/traps/room movement/etc.) but actually getting them working was (still is) a challenge. There are a ton of bugs and things that don't work well or at all. Probably should/need to reconfigure things to try to make them work better (more functions could help, as well as an array for the rooms. Had trouble making it work at first so switched to a different way to do it. Should research more about it). Pretty much everything could be reworked to function better.
